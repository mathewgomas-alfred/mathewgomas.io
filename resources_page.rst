Pre-installed Python Plugins
============================

Krita's capabilities can be enhanced by using specific plugins. This list will present the plugins that come with Krita by default, as well as other plugins made by the community. If you would like to learn more about how you can make your own plugin, visit the :ref:`krita_python_plugin_howto` area.

If you want to know more about an individual plugin, you can access the plugin's manual by going to :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Krita...` menu, and then choosing the Python Plugin Manager Tab. There, you can click on a specific plugin, and the manual will appear in the bottom text area. 

Assign Profile Dialog:
----------------------

    Allows you to assign a profile to an image instead of converting it to that profile. The difference is that it allows only interpreting the colors by the new profile, but not change any of the values. It can be found in :menuselection:`Tools --> Assign Profile to Image...`, and will present a list of profiles for the current image's color model.

Batch Exporter
--------------

    Plugin for Game Developers and Graphic Designers.
    
    - Allows batch export of assets to multiple sizes, file types and custom paths;
    - Renames layers quickly with the smart rename tool;
    - Export all layers or only selected layers;

    By default, the plugin exports the images in an :file:`export` folder next to the Krita document, and follows the structure of your layer stack.


Channels to Layers
------------------
    Splits channels from a layer to sub-layers. To use, select the layer to convert, click on :menuselection:`Tools --> Scripts --> Channels to Layers...`, and choose options from the user interface. 

Color Space
-----------

    Allows you to select a document and convert it's colors to a new color space, like RGBA, CMYKA, L*a*b, etc.

-------------------------------

    Aims to simplify comics creation by: 

    - Giving the artist a way to organize and quickly access their pages;
    - Helping the artist(s) deal with the boring bits meta data bits of a comic project by giving a meta-data editor that gives suggestions, explanation and occasionally a dab of humor;
    - Making export set-and-forget type of affair where a single click can export to multiple formats with proper meta-data.

    Also features options to to assist exporting to specific formats, like "Advanced Comic Book Format", CBZ or Epub. 

    To use this plugin, activate the "Comics Manager" Docker.

Krita Script Starter
--------------------

    A script that helps set up the various files that Krita expects to see when it runs a script, namely:

    - The .desktop meta data file;
    - The package directory;
    - The __init__.py file;
    - The main python file for your package;
    - The Manual.html file for your documentation;

Last Documents Docker
---------------------

    Script that shows the recently opened documents as a thumbnail image. To use this, activate the "Last Documents" docker.

Mixer Slider Docker
-------------------

    Docker that allows you to choose from the gradients between two colors.

    - Scroll the pages to access more results;
    - Click on an image to create a layer, with the scale that you specify.

Python Plugin Importer
----------------------

    Imports Python plugins from zip files.

Quick Settings Docker 
---------------------

    A Docker that allows you to quickly set the opacity, flow and size from a predefined list. Now, when you have a document open, and a brush selected, select any of the entries in the "Quick Settings" docker to change them. The docker doesn’t update when changing brush size any other way, so it will always show the last selected change.

Ten Brushes

-----------

    Similar to Ten Brushes, allows the assign of Python scripts to one of ten configurable hotkeys. 

User-made Python Plugins
========================

To install and manage your plugins, see the second area of the :ref:`krita_python_plugin_howto` page to know how to get Krita to recognize your plugin.


AnimLayers (Animate with Layers)
--------------------------------

    Animate specific layers. You animate a specific range of layers by prefixing the layer name with the same letters. For example *PL* then all the layers where the name starts with *PL* will be part of the animation. In the AnimLayers window you enter PL in the Key field. You can also select a layer with the wanted key and press the Get key button.

Python auto-complete for text editors
-------------------------------------

    If you have the Krita source code, you can use this to generate the auto-complete file for Python. Many Python editors need a :file:`.PY` file to read for auto-complete information. This script reads the C++ header files and creates a Python file that can be used for auto-completion.
