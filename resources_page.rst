Vector libraries
================

Composition templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside the zip archive you'll find all composition templates separate and in a form of a vector library, so all the shapes are easy to access after the import.

The composition templates include: rule of thirds, golden ratio, golden spiral, golden triangle 1, golden triangle 2, harmonious triangle, film safe area template, baroque diagonal and centre.

Link: https://gumroad.com/l/CHhlx

Feather icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of open source icons from https://feathericons.com but in a Vector Library form, so it can be easily accessed from inside Krita after the import. Each icon is designed on a 24x24 grid with an emphasis on simplicity, consistency, and flexibility.

Link: https://github.com/MiAlmeida/krita-feather


Templates
=========
Templates are .kra files that you can base your new documents on. To learn more see :ref:`create_new_document_from_template`.


Storyboard template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The layout and layer setup is inspired by traditional Studio Ghibli storyboards, and Tony Gaddis’ storyboarding process.

.. _custom_python_plugins:

User-made Python Plugins
========================

This list describes only plugins that are **not** available in Krita, so you need to download and install the ones you'd like to use.

.. seealso::

    If you want to check descriptions of a plugin available in Krita by default (without a need to download), see :ref:`default_python_plugins`.


To learn how to install and manage your plugins, see :ref:`install_custom_python_plugins`.

If you want to know more about an individual plugin, you can access the plugin's manual by going to :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Krita...` menu, and then choosing the ``Python Plugin Manager`` tab. Then you can click on a specific plugin and the manual will appear in the bottom text area.

.. caution::

    Custom Python plugins are made by users of Krita and the Krita team does not guarantee that they work, that they are useful or that they are *safe*. Note that a Python plugin can do everything that Krita can do, which means for example access to your files. Krita team isn't responsible for any damage you might suffer from a custom plugin, this list is informational purposes only and you install any of the custom plugins on your own risk.

    If you have information that any of the plugins below is dangerous for the user, please contact Krita team on `kimageshop@kde.org`.

Other resources
===============


Krita Plugin Generator

    An extension to VSCode that generates a Plugin Template for Krita (like `Krita Script Starter`, but directly in VSCode).

    Available here: https://github.com/cg-cnu/vscode-krita-plugin-generator

Python auto-complete for text editors

    If you have the Krita source code, you can use this Python script to generate the auto-complete file for Python. Many Python editors need a :file:`.py` file to read for auto-complete information. This script reads the C++ header files from Krita's source code and creates a Python file that can be used for auto-completion.

    Available here: https://github.com/scottpetrovic/krita-python-auto-complete
