Import Animation
================

Krita has several options for allowing you to import an animation.

.. _import_frames:

Import Frames
-------------

.. image:: /images/animation/Animation_set_everything.png

Add images.
   Add frames. You can select multiple frames in the file chooser.
Remove.
   Remove the selected frame
Add hold frames automatically.
   If a frame sequence has gaps, such as a sequence that has frames 1, 2 and 5, ticking this option will input empty frames at 3 and 4.

Order
~~~~~

Ascending vs Descending
   Whether it will import the frames in order from lowest to highest (ascending), or from highest to lowest (descending).
Numerical vs Alphabetical
   Whether it will use numbers or Alphabetical ordering for the frames.

Timing
~~~~~~

Start at
   The frame number to import at. Importing at 3 will have the resulting animation start at frame 3 within Krita.
Step
   The amount of frames to input for each imported frame. For importing a 6 fps animation into a 24 fps animation, you will need to set this to 24 / 6 = 4. This will ensure the playback speed stays the same.
Source FPS
   This displays what Krita thinks the fps of the input is with the current timing settings. You can use this to make sure that the input you made is correct with the input

.. _import_video_animation:

Import video file
