Rectangle Tool
==============

|toolrectangle|

This tool can be used to paint rectangles, or create rectangle shapes on a vector layer. Click and hold |mouseleft| to indicate one corner of the rectangle, drag to the opposite corner, and release the button.

Hotkeys and Sticky-keys
-----------------------

There's no default hotkey for switching to rectangle.

If you hold the :kbd:`Shift` key while drawing, a square will be drawn instead of a rectangle. Holding the :kbd:`Ctrl` key will change the way the rectangle is constructed. Normally, the first mouse click indicates one corner and the second click the opposite. With the :kbd:`Ctrl` key, the initial mouse position indicates the center of the rectangle, and the final mouse position indicates a corner. You can press the :kbd:`Alt` key while still keeping |mouseleft| down to move the rectangle to a different location.

You can change between the corner/corner and center/corner drawing methods as often
as you want by pressing or releasing the :kbd:`Ctrl` key, provided that you keep |mouseleft| pressed. With the :kbd:`Ctrl` key pressed, mouse movements will affect all four corners of the rectangle (relative to the center), without the :kbd:`Ctrl` key, one of the corners is unaffected.

.. versionadded:: 5.0

If you hold :kbd:`Ctrl` and :kbd:`Alt` keys while drawing, the rectangle will be rotated around the marked corner. If used with holding :kbd:`Shift` key, a square will be rotated around the marked corner.

Scale
    This allows you to scale the pattern used in the fill.

Size
~~~~

Width
    Gives the current width. Use the lock to force the next rectangle made to this width.
Height
    Gives the current height. Use the lock to force the next rectangle made to this height.
Ratio
    .. versionadded:: 4.2

    Gives the current ratio. Use the lock to force the next rectangle made to this ratio.

Round X
