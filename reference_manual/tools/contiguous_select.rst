=========================
Contiguous Selection Tool
=========================

|toolselectcontiguous|

This tool, represented by a magic wand, allows you to make :ref:`selections_basics` by selecting a point of color. It will select any contiguous areas of a similar color to the one you selected. You can adjust the "fuzziness" of the tool in the tool options dock. A lower number will select colors closer to the color that you chose in the first place.

Hotkeys and Sticky keys
-----------------------

* :kbd:`Shift +` |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'add'. You can release the :kbd:`Shift` key while dragging, but it will still be set to 'add'. Same for the others.
* :kbd:`Alt +` |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'subtract'.
* :kbd:`Ctrl +` |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'replace'.
* :kbd:`Shift + Alt +` |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'intersect'.

.. versionadded:: 4.2

   * Hovering over a selection allows you to move it.
   * |mouseright| will open up a selection quick menu with amongst others the ability to edit the selection.

.. note::

    You can switch the behavior of the :kbd:`Alt` key to use the :kbd:`Ctrl` key instead by toggling the switch in the :ref:`general_settings`.

Tool Options
------------

Anti-aliasing
    This toggles whether or not to give selections feathered edges. Some people prefer hard-jagged edges for their selections.
Fuzziness
    This controls whether or not the contiguous selection sees another color as a border.
Grow/Shrink selection.
    This value extends/contracts the shape beyond its initial size.
Feathering
    This value will add a soft border to the selection-shape.
Sample
    .. versionadded:: 4.3
    
    Select which layers to use as a reference for the contiguous select tool. The options are:
    
    Current Layer
        Only use the currently selected layer.
    All layers
        Use all visible layers.
    Color Labeled Layers
        Use only the layers specified with a certain color label. This is useful for complex images, where you might have multiple lineart layers. Label them with the appropriate color label and use these labels to mark which layers to use as a reference.

Labels Used
    .. versionadded:: 4.3

    Used with the 'Color Labeled Layers' option above.
