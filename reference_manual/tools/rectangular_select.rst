Rectangular Selection Tool
==========================

|toolselectrect|

This tool, represented by a rectangle with a dashed border, allows you to make :ref:`selections_basics` in a rectangular shape.  To create a rectangular selection simply |mouseleft| and drag on the area of the canvas that you wish to select.

.. important::

    Most of the behavior of the Rectangular Selection Tool is common to all other selection tools, please make sure to read :ref:`selections_basics` to learn more about this tool.

Hotkeys and Stickykeys
----------------------

* :kbd:`Ctrl + R` selects this tool.
* :kbd:`R` sets the selection to 'replace' in the tool options, this is the default mode.
* :kbd:`A` sets the selection to 'add' in the tool options.
* :kbd:`S` sets the selection to 'subtract' in the tool options.
* |mouseleft| + :kbd:`Shift` constrains the selection to a perfect square. (Make sure to press |mouseleft| before :kbd:`Shift`)
* |mouseleft| + :kbd:`Ctrl` makes the selection resize from the center. (Make sure to press |mouseleft| before :kbd:`Ctrl`)
* |mouseleft| + :kbd:`Alt` allows you to move the selection. (Make sure to press |mouseleft| before :kbd:`Alt`)
* :kbd:`Shift` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'add'. You can release the :kbd:`Shift` key while dragging, but it will still be set to 'add'. Same for the others.
* :kbd:`Alt` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'subtract'.
* :kbd:`Ctrl` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'replace'.
* :kbd:`Shift + Alt +` |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'intersect'.

.. versionadded:: 4.2

   * Hovering your cursor over the dashed line of the selection, or marching ants as it is commonly called, turns the cursor into the move tool icon, which you |mouseleft| and drag to move the selection.
   * |mouseright| will open up a selection quick menu with amongst others the ability to edit the selection.

   * |mouseleft| + :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt` allows you to rotate the rectangle around the marked corner. (Make sure to press |mouseleft| before :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt`)
   * |mouseleft| + :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + Shift` allows you to rotate a constrained perfect square around the marked corner. (Make sure to press |mouseleft| before :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + Shift`)


.. hint::

    To subtract a perfect square, you can follow two different methods:

    1. Press :kbd:`S` to subtract then |mouseleft| to select and press :kbd:`Shift` while dragging to constrain to a perfect square.

    2. Press :kbd:`Alt +` |mouseleft|, then release the :kbd:`Alt` key while dragging and press :kbd:`Shift` to constrain.

.. tip::

    You can switch the behavior of the :kbd:`Alt` key to use :kbd:`Ctrl` instead by toggling the switch in the :ref:`general_settings`
