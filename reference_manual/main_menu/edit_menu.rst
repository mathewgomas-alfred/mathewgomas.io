    Cut 
        - If shapes are selected, then they are cut from the image and saved into the clipboard.
        - If :ref:`selections_basics` are active, then that area is cut in all the layers selected in the layer docker and saved into the clipboard.

    Copy
        Similar to :term:`Cut`, but elements are only copied into the clipboard without modifying existing image. Shortcut: :kbd:`Ctrl + C`

    Cut (Sharp)
        This prevents semi-transparent areas from appearing on your cut pixels, making them either fully opaque or fully transparent.

    Copy Merged
        Copies the selection over all layers. Shortcut: :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + C`

    Paste 
        - If vector shapes are in the copied buffer, the shapes are pasted into the image as a new layer.
        - If layers are in the copied buffer, these layers are pasted into the image above the active layer or inside a group layer if the active layer is a group layer.
        - Shortcut: :kbd:`Ctrl + V`

    Paste at Cursor
        Same as :term:`Paste`, but aligns the image to the cursor. Shortcut: :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + V`

    Paste into Active Layer
