==========
Tools Menu
==========

This contains three things.

Scripting
---------

When you have python scripting enabled and have scripts toggled, this is where most scripts are stored by default.

Recording
---------
.. deprecated:: 3.0
    Macro recording and playing is disabled since 3.0 due to unmaintained code and buggy behaviour leading to crash.

Record a macro. You do this by pressing start, drawing something and then pressing stop. This feature can only record brush strokes. The resulting file is stored as a \*.kritarec file.

Macros
------
.. deprecated:: 3.0
    Macro recording and playing is disabled since 3.0 due to unmaintained code and buggy behaviour leading to crash.

Play back or edit a krita rec file. The edit can only change the brush preset on strokes or add and remove filters.
