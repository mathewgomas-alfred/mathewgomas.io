Recorder Docker
===============

.. versionadded: 5.0

You may have seen artists show little progress movies of their work. This is called a time lapse! Normally a time lapse is recorded using outside software, like OBS, and then sped up around 16 times, and they are used to convey the whole amount of effort that went into an image. The recorder docker simplifies making a timelapse, by taking a snapshot every stroke and then letting you :ref:`render it to a video file with ffmpeg <render_animation>`. Because this docker relies on FFMpeg, it cannot be used on Android.

The recorder docker makes a snapshot of the canvas every few seconds, or at the end of every stroke. You can tell it's turned on because there will be a :guilabel:`recording` symbol in the status bar, which is red when it's making snapshots and white when it's on standby.

It stores these snapshots as :ref:`JPEGs <file_jpeg>` in a designated folder, and keeps tabs on which of these belong to which drawing. Because JPEG doesn't support above 8 bit, the docker currently does not work for higher bits depths. Because it stores the snapshots, that means you can take breaks, close the image, turn off the computer, come back a month later. However, snapshots can take up quite a bit of space, so if you are running out of space, don't forget to check the temporary folder!

At the end, you can turn the snapshots into a video file, ready for your favourite video sharing site.

.. note::

   Some people also call time lapses 'speed paints', but these are not the same thing. A speed paint is when you try to draw an image in a far shorter time than is usual for you. For example, drawing a whole landscape in 15 to 30 minutes. People like to record their speed paints, and because both speed paints and time lapses are videos, people often confuse them.
   
   Similarly, this tool should also not be confused with Macro Recording, which is when you tell the program to record all your actions into a file, and have it play those back at a later date. Krita currently does not have this functionality.

   
Docker Options
--------------

Recordings Directory:
   The directory where the snapshots are kept. Note the :guilabel:`Manage Recordings` button, which will assist you in selecting old recordings to remove.
Capture Interval:
   ???
Quality:
   Control the quality of the JPEG snapshots. The lower the quality, the lower the file size, but too low and you will get a messy looking recording.
Resolution:
   Lower the resolution of the snapshot. This can drastically reduce size without losing too much quality.
Record in Isolate Mode.
   Record when isolate mode is on. May cause flickering. (??????)
Record automatically
   Start recording the instant an image is created or loaded. This option is useful for those who want to record each of their drawings.

Finally, there's :guilabel:`Record` and :guilabel:`Export`. The former starts and stops recording. The latter lets you render the current drawing's timelapse.


Export Options
--------------

Compare these options with the one on the :ref:`render_animation` page, as they do largely the same things.

Recording info:
   Shows what kind of frames and how many frames are taken into account when creating the final video file. Pressing :guilabel:`Open Record Directory` will allow you to open the folder where the recordings are located in your file browser.
Input FPS:
   How many frames per second should go in. For example, to make your time lapse twice faster, this value should be double that of the :guilabel:`Video fps`. (???: note, the tooltip for this is very engrish)
Video FPS:
   The actual FPS of the video.
Resize:
   Scale the final video. (?????)
FFMpeg:
   The location of the ffmpeg executable.
Render As:
   Select the render setting to use. MP4 x264 is sufficient for most drawings and will be accepted on most video sharing sites.
Video Location:
   Where to put the resulting video.
Video Duration:
   The final video length in seconds. This will change as you change the FPS settings.

After Export
------------

Watch it:
   This will open the resulting file in the default video player on your system.
Show in folder:
   This will open the folder where the file is located in your file browser.
Remove recordings:
   Remove the snapshots from your computer.
