=======
Texture
=======

This allows you to have textured strokes. This parameter always shows up as two parameters:

Texture
-------

Pattern
    Which pattern you'll be using. 
Scale
    The size of the pattern. 1.0 is 100%.

    .. image:: /images/brushes/Krita_2_9_brushengine_texture_05.png
Horizontal Offset & Vertical Offset
    How much a brush is offset, random offset sets a new per stroke.

Texturing mode
    All texture modes affect the alpha channel, with the exception of *lightness map* and *gradient map*, which
    affect the color channels.

    .. image:: /images/brushes/Krita_2_9_brushengine_texture_01.png
    .. image:: /images/brushes/Krita_4_4_brushengine_texture_lightness_gradient_demo.png

    In the following explanations, the sample strokes go from low strength on the left side to high strength on the
    right side. The top stroke uses a hard brush tip and the bottom one a soft brush tip. On the left side of the
    strokes there are two non-textured dots, just for comparison sake.

    Multiply
        Uses alpha multiplication to determine the effect of the texture. Has a soft feel.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/multiply.png
    Subtract
        Uses subtraction to determine the effect of the texture. Has a harsher, more texture feel.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/subtract.png
    Lightness Map
        .. versionadded:: 4.4
        
        Applies lightness values of the texture to the paint.  Can be used to simulate paper/canvas, or for painting a texture, like reptile skin or tree bark.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/lightness_map.png
    Gradient Map
        .. versionadded:: 4.4

        Maps gray/lightness values of the texture to the currently selected gradient.  Useful for painting textures with multiple colors, like reptile skin, tree bark, stars, etc.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/gradient_map.png
    Darken
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        This mode chooses the minimum alpha value between the brush tip and the texture. The effect is as if the texture
        made holes in the opaque areas of the brush tip.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/darken.png
    Overlay
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        The texture is softly applied to the semi-transparent areas of the brush tip.
        This mode produces a result similar to *multiply* but allowing for full coverage when high strength values are used.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/overlay.png
    Color Dodge
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        This mode produces features with somewhat hard edges on the brush tip by making it more opaque where the texture
        values are brighter.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/color_dodge.png
    Burn
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        This mode produces holes with somewhat hard edges on the brush tip by making it more transparent where the texture
        values are darker.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/color_burn.png
    Linear Dodge
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        Similar to *color dodge* but the opacity of the brush tip is increased even more.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/linear_dodge.png
    Linear Burn
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        The result is similar to *burn* but with the opacity decreased a bit more. It also is similar to the *subtract*
        mode but with the texture inverted.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/linear_burn.png
    Hard Mix (Photoshop)
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        This mode produces a result similar to *burn* or *linear burn* and allows to obtain full coverage when high strength values
        are used. The resulting edges are very hard (in fact, aliased).

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/hard_mix_ps.png
    Hard Mix Softer (Photoshop)
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        This mode tries to emulate *hard mix (photoshop)* while producing softer, antialiased, edges.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/hard_mix_softer_ps.png
    Height
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        This mode is similar to the *subtract* mode but with a higher range of possibilities when applying the strength.
        Contrary to *subtract*, it allows to achieve full coverage with one stroke.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/height.png
    Linear Height
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        Same as *height* but combined with *multiply* to achieve softer transitions.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/linear_height.png
    Height (Photoshop)
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        As the *height* mode, this mode is similar to the *subtract* mode but with a higher range of possibilities when applying
        the strength. Contrary to *subtract*, it allows to achieve full coverage with one stroke. This mode tries to
        emulate the height mode present in Photoshop and it only differs from Krita's *height* mode on how the strength
        is mapped in the algorithm. When using a strength value of 0.1 the results are almost identical to the *subtract*
        mode with a strength of 1.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/height_ps.png
    Linear Height (Photoshop)
        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        Same as *height (photoshop)* but combined with *multiply* to achieve softer transitions.

        .. image:: /images/brushes/texture_blending_modes/linear_height_ps.png

Cutoff policy
    Cutoff policy will determine what range and where the strength will affect the textured outcome.

    Disabled
        Doesn't cut off. Full range will be used.
    Pattern
        Cuts the pattern off.
    Brush
        Cuts the brush tip off.

Cutoff
    Cutoff is... the grayscale range that you can limit the texture to. This also affects the limit takes by the strength. In the below example, we move from the right arrow moved close to the left one, resulting in only the darkest values being drawn. After that, three images with larger range, and underneath that, three ranges with the left arrow moved, result in the darkest values being cut away, leaving only the lightest. The last example is the pattern without cutoff.

Invert Pattern
    Invert the pattern.

Brightness and Contrast

.. versionadded:: 3.3.1

    Adjust the pattern with a simple brightness/contrast filter to make it easier to use. Because Subtract and Multiply work differently, it's recommended to use different values with each:

    .. image:: /images/brushes/Krita_3_1_brushengine_texture_07.png
    
.. versionadded:: 4.4
    Neutral Point adjustment:

Neutral Point
    Adjust the gray value that is considered neutral in the texture.  0.5 keeps the texture as is; higher values make the texture darker, and lower values make the texture lighter.  Works a bit differently from the brightness option, and is mostly useful to adjust existing textures to work well with Lightness Map and Gradient Map modes (though it can have applications with the other two modes).

Strength
--------

This allows you to set the texture to Sensors. It will use the cutoff to continuously draw lighter values of the texture (making the result darker).   

.. versionadded:: 4.4
    For Lightness Map and Gradient Map modes, :guilabel:`Strength` controls how much of the texture is applied compared to how much of the selected paint color comes through.
