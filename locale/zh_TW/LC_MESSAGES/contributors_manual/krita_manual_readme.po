"system like gitlab or github this is a merge or pull request), people who "
"maintain the original files will have to look them over and can make "
"comments about things needing to change. This allows them to comment on "
"things like typos, over-complicated writing but also things that are "
"incorrect. After a patch has been accepted it can be pushed into the version "
