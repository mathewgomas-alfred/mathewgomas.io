"So, up till now we’ve done only parallel projection. This is called like "
"that because all the projection lines we drew were parallel ones."

"The point where all the rays come together is called the focal point, and "

"As you can see from the image, the focal point is not an end-point of the "
"rays. Rather, it is where the rays cross before diverging again… The only "

"That went pretty well. As you can see we sorta ‘merged’ the two sides into "
"one (resulting into the purple side square) so we had an easier time "

"the vertical lines"
