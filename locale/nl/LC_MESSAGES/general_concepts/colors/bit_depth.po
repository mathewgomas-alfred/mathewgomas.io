"differences between floating point and integer type variables, and because "
"Scene-referred imaging allows for negative values, you have about 10-11bits "
"of precision per channel in 16 bit floating point compared to 16 bit in 16 "

"float is roughly equal to 23-24 bits of precision per channel (16777216 "
