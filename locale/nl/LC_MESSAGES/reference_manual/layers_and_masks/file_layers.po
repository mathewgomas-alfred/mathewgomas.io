msgid "File Layers are references to files outside of the document: If the referenced document updates, the file layer will update. Do not remove the original file on your computer once you add it to Krita. Deleting your original image will break the file layer. If Krita cannot find the original file, it'll ask you where to find it. File layers cannot display animations."

msgid "If the imported layer and the image have a different resolution, it'll scale the filelayer by scaling it's resolution. In other words, import a 600dpi A4 image onto a 300dpi A4 image, and the filelayer will be scaled to fit precisely on the 300dpi image. Useful for comics, where the ink-layer is prefered to be at a higher resolution than the colors."

msgid "You can turn any set of layers into a file layer by rightclicking them and doing :menuselection:`convert --> convert to file layer`. It will then open a save prompt for the file location and when done will save the file and replace the layer with a file layer pointing at that file."
