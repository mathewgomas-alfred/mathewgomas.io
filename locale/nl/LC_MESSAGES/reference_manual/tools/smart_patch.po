"The smart patch tool allows you to seamlessly remove elements from the "
"image. It does this by letting you draw the area which has the element you "
"wish to remove, and then it will attempt to use patterns already existing in "

"Patch size determines how big the size of the pattern to choose is. This "
"will be best explained with some testing, but if the surrounding image has "
"mostly small elements, like branches, a small patch size will give better "
"results, while a big patch size will be better for images with big elements, "
"so they get reused as a whole."
