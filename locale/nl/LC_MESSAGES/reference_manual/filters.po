"Filters are little scripts or operations you can run on your drawing. You "
"can visualise them as real-world camera filters that can make a photo darker "
"or blurrier. Or perhaps like a coffee filter, where only water and coffee "
"gets through, and the ground coffee stays behind."

"Filters are unique to digital painting in terms of complexity, and their "
"part of the painting pipeline. Some artists only use filters to adjust their "
"colours a little. Others, using Filter Layers and Filter Masks use them to "
"dynamically update a part of an image to be filtered. This way, they can "
"keep the original underneath without changing the original image. This is a "
"part of a technique called 'non-destructive' editing."

"Filters can be accessed via the :guilabel:`Filters` menu. Krita has two "
"types of filters: Internal and G'MIC filters."

"Internal filters are often multithreaded, and can thus be used with the "
"filter brush or the adjustment filters."
