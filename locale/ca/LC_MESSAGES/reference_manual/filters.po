"Filters are little scripts or operations you can run on your drawing. You can"
" visualize them as real-world camera filters that can make a photo darker or"
" blurrier. Or perhaps like a coffee filter, where only water and coffee gets"
" through, and the ground coffee stays behind."

"Filters are unique to digital painting in terms of complexity, and their part"
" of the painting pipeline. Some artists only use filters to adjust their"
" colors a little. Others, using Filter Layers and Filter Masks use them to"
" dynamically update a part of an image to be filtered. This way, they can"
" keep the original underneath without changing the original image. This is a"
" part of a technique called 'non-destructive' editing."
