"You can toggle them by clicking the lightbulb icon on a layer that is "

"Since 4.2 onion skins are disabled on layers whose default pixel is fully "

"The term onionskin comes from the fact that onions are semi-transparent. In "
"traditional animation animators would make their initial animations on "
"semitransparent paper on top of an light-table (of the special animators "
"variety), and they’d start with so called keyframes, and then draw frames in "
"between. For that, they would place said keyframes below the frame they were "
"working on, and the light table would make the lines of the keyframes shine "
"through, so they could reference them."

"The slider and the button with zero offset control the master opacity and "
