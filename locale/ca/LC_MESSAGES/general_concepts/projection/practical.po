"So, if computers can already automate a ton, and it is fairly complicated, "
"is there still a use for a traditional 2d artist to learn this?"

"Yes, actually. The benefit that 2d art still has over 3d is that it's plain "
"faster for single images, especially with complicated subjects like faces "
"and bodies."
msgstr ""
"Sí, en realitat. El benefici que encara té l'art en 2D sobre el 3D és que és "

"Perspective projection can help a lot getting down those annoying poses, "
"like people lying down. It also helps when combining 2d and 3d, as when you "
"know where the camera is in the 3d render, you can use that in a projection "
"to get the character projected."
msgstr ""
"La projecció en perspectiva pot ajudar molt a reduir aquestes postures "
"molestes, com la gent que se'n va a dormir. També ajuda quan es combina el "
"2D i el 3D, ja que quan se sap on està la càmera al renderitzador en 3D, "
"podeu utilitzar això en una projecció per a projectar el personatge."

"The side view of a person lying down is often easy to draw, but the top view "
"or the view from the feet isn’t. Hence why we use the side view to do "
"perspective projection on."

"Now, with this one we have a second vanishing point above the front-view. It "
"should be about the same distance above the front-view as it is above the "
"head of the rotated side-view. The projection plane should also be the same "
"distance from the vanishing point, but that doesn’t mean it has to be "
"behind. This is something I avoided in the earlier examples, because it "
"makes the working field really messy, but if you look up perspective "
"projection you’ll see multiple examples of this method."

"Also of note is that you actually should be having the view plane/projection "
"plane perfectly perpendicular to the angle of the focal point, otherwise you "
"get odd distortion, this doesn’t happen here, which means this sitting "
"person is a bit more stretched vertically than necessary."

"Here you can see that the misalignment of the vanishing point to the "
"projection plane causes skewing which was then fixed by Krita’s transform "
"tools, technically it’s of course correct, but what is correct doesn’t "
"always look good. (I also mess up the position of the shoulder for a good "
"while if you look closely.)"

"I probably didn’t make as nice result images as I could have, especially if "
"you compare it to the 3d images. However, you can still see that the main "
"landmarks are there. The real use of this technique lies in poses though, "
"and it allows you to iterate on a pose quite quickly once you get the hang "
