"png is a :ref:`lossless <lossless_compression>` file format, which means that"
" it is able to maintain all the colors of your image perfectly. It does so at"
" the cost of the file size being big, and therefore it is recommended to try"
" :ref:`file_jpg` for images with a lot of gradients and different colors."
" Grayscale images will do better in png as well as images with a lot of text"
" and sharp contrasts, like comics."

" animation support to png, apng and mng, the former is unofficial and the"
" latter too complicated, so neither have really taken off yet."
