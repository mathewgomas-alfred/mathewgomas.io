"``.png``, or Portable Network Graphics, is a modern alternative to :ref:"
"`file_gif` and with that and :ref:`file_jpg` it makes up the three main "
"formats that are widely supported on the internet."

"PNG is a :ref:`lossless <lossless_compression>` file format, which means "
"that it is able to maintain all the colors of your image perfectly. It does "
"so at the cost of the file size being big, and therefore it is recommended "
"to try :ref:`file_jpg` for images with a lot of gradients and different "
"colors. Grayscale images will do better in PNG as well as images with a lot "
"of text and sharp contrasts, like comics."

"Like :ref:`file_gif`, PNG can support indexed color. Unlike :ref:`file_gif`, "
"PNG doesn't support animation. There have been two attempts at giving "
"animation support to PNG, APNG and MNG, the former is unofficial and the "
"latter too complicated, so neither have really taken off yet."

"Since 4.2 we support saving HDR to PNG as according to the `W3C PQ HDR PNG "
"standard <https://www.w3.org/TR/png-hdr-pq/>`_. To save as such files, "
"toggle :guilabel:`Save as HDR image (Rec. 2020 PQ)`, which will convert your "
"image to the Rec 2020 PQ color space and then save it as a special HDR PNG."
