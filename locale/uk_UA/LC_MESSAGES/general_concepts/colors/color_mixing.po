"Much like physical media, there are many ways to mix colors together in "
"Krita. Traditional painters and illustrators often use techniques like "
"**glazing**, **scumbling**, and **hatching** to mix colors directly on their "
"canvas, on top of mixing colors together on a **palette** or even within the "
"hairs of their **brush**. With a little bit of practice and know-how, and "
"thanks to the variety of powerful tools in Krita, we can mimic all of these "
"mixing techniques in digital painting."

msgstr "Змішування на полотні"

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:26
msgid ""
"On-canvas mixing techniques are ones where multiple colors are combined "
"directly on the canvas as the artist paints. This takes a few forms, "
"including **layering semi-transparent color** on top of another color, using "
"**texture** to change how a color is perceived, or even in the interaction "
"between two areas of wet paint in traditional media. Bottom line: on-canvas "
"mixing happens right on the canvas and is a great tool for artistic "
"exploration and \"happy accidents\"."

msgid "Glazing"
msgstr "Лакування"

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:35
msgid ""
"In traditional painting, **glazing** is overlaying many different semi-"
"transparent layers to create on-canvas color mixtures. Likewise, in digital "
"painting we can also use glazing to mix colors directly on our canvas. This "
"is one of the most fundamental and commonly used mixing techniques in "
"digital painting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:37
msgid ""
"We first lay down a semi-transparent layer on top of another color that we "
"intend to mix with. Then, we pick the **resultant color** with :kbd:`Ctrl` + "
"|mouseleft| (this can be configured in the canvas input settings), and paint "
"with that. Depending on our brush's **opacity setting**, each time we glaze "
"one color over another we will get a color that is somewhere between those "
"two colors, often leading to a nice mixture."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:39
msgid ""
"We can mix even more easily with glazing when we set our brush's **flow** to "
"a lower setting. Subtly different than opacity, :ref:`flow "
"<option_opacity_n_flow>` is transparency per dab instead of stroke, and so "
"it gives us softer strokes without giving up control."
msgstr ""

"Furthermore, we can combine glazing with various **blending modes** to "

"Крім того, ми можемо поєднати глазурування із різноманітними **режимами "

"Then, using a brush with low flow (~0.30), we can pick the resulting colors "

"**Off-canvas** mixing has basically always been a core tool for artists "
"everywhere; when we think of the stereotypical artist we might imagine "
"someone with a few **brushes** in one hand and a wooden **palette** in the "
"other. Whether it's oils, watercolor, or other traditional media, for the "
"artist to have absolute control over their colors it's crucial to have some "
"kind of palette, plate, jar, or other **off-canvas area** to mix colors "
"together. While it's easy to overlook this in digital painting (where "
"selecting fresh new colors without mixing at all is both easy and free*), "

"Krita, like almost every art and graphics program, has a :ref:"
"`color_picker_tool` which allows you to very quickly sample a color from any "
"pixel on your canvas. While this tool may seem relatively simple and humble, "
"it is also one of the most important and commonly used tools in the digital "
"artist's toolbox - perhaps only second to the brush! In fact, the color "

"combination with on-canvas techniques like glazing and scumbling to produce "
"smooth blends of color."

"The Color Picker Blending feature changes the way that picking colors has "
"traditionally worked for decades; instead of completely replacing your "

"with your current brush color."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:119

"You can use Color Picker Blending much like a physical paint brush in "
"traditional media. If you were to dip your paint brush into a pool of *blue* "
"paint, and then immediately dip again into a pool of *red* paint and paint a "
"stoke across your canvas, the stoke wouldn't be pure red - it would be some "
"combination of blue and red which would mix to create an intermediate purple "
"color. Which shade of purple would depend on the ratio of paints that mix "
"together within the hairs of your brush, and this is essentially what the "
"Color Picker's \"blend\" option controls: what percentage of sampled color "
"is mixed together with your current brush color!"

"Not only does Krita's Color Picker Blending feel even more like mixing "
"paints, it is also completely off-canvas and independent of opacity, flow, "
"shape, and other brush settings. Furthermore, unlike most on-canvas mixing "
"techniques, Color Picker Blending works regardless of the location of colors "
"on your canvas - enabling your to mix with colors at any position, on any "
"layer, or even in different documents! Quickly mix lighting colors with "
"local colors, mix the ambient sky color into shadows, create atmospheric "
"depth, mix from a preselected palette of colors in another layer/document, "
"etc."

"To use Color Picker Blending, simply set the \"blend\" option in the **Tool "
"Options Docker** while the Color Picker Tool is active; setting blend to "
"100% will cause your Color Picker to work in the traditional way (completely "
"replacing your brush color with the picked color), setting to around 50% "
"will give you a half-way mix between colors, and setting to a lower value "
"will create more subtle shifts in colors each click. Of course, blending "
"affects both your dedicated Color Picker Tool as well as the :kbd:`Ctrl +` |"
"mouseleft| shortcut."
msgstr ""

"Clicking and dragging the Color Picker around the canvas currently causes it "
"to sample many times as it switches pixels. You can use this trait to "
"quickly soak up more color by \"dipping\" your color picker into a color and "
"swirling it around. This can be pretty satisfying! However, this also means "
"that some care must be taken to prevent from accidentally picking up more "
"color than you want. It's pretty easy to click a single pixel only one time "
"using a **mouse**, but when painting with a **drawing tablet and pen** it "
"can sometimes be desirable to use a slightly lower blend setting!"

"Limiting the number of colors we use and then mixing tends to give a more "
"cohesive palette, as we're not trying to do too much at once. This cohesive "
