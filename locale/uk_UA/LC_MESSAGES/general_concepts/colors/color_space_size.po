"For exchanging between programs and devices: most CMYK profiles are a little "
"bigger than our default sRGB in places, while in other places, it's smaller. "
"To get the best conversion, having your image in a space that encompasses "
"both your screen profile as your printer profile."

"On the left we have an artifact-ridden color managed jpeg file with an ACES "
"sRGBtrc v2 profile attached(or not, depending on mediawiki's mood, if not "

"Each of the gradients is the gradient from the max of a given channel. As "
"you can see, the mid-tone of the ACES color space is much brighter than the "
"mid-tone of the RGB colorspace, and this is because the primaries are "
"further apart."

"What this means for us is that when we start mixing or applying filters, "
"Krita can output values higher than visible, but also generate more correct "
"mixes and gradients. In particular, when color correcting, the bigger space "
"can help with giving more precise information."
