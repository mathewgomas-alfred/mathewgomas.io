"Отже, досі ми мали справу із паралельними проекціями. Назва цих проекцій"

"The point where all the rays come together is called the focal point, and "

"As you can see from the image, the focal point is not an end-point of the "

"difference is that the resulting image will be inverted. Even in our eyes "
"this inversion happens, but our brains are used to this awkwardness since "
"childhood and turn it around automatically."

"That went pretty well. As you can see we sorta ‘merged’ the two sides into "
"one (resulting into the purple side square) so we had an easier time "
"projecting. The projection is limited to one or two vanishing point type "

"the vertical lines"
