"Photographs have the problem that they have a lot of little gradients, which"
" means that you cannot index the file like you can with :ref:`file_gif` and"
" expect the result to look good. What jpeg instead does is that it converts"
" the file to a perceptual color space(:ref:`YCrCb <model_ycrcb>`), and then"
" compresses the channels that encode the colors, while keeping the channel"
" that holds information about the relative lightness uncompressed. This works"
" really well because human eye-sight is not as sensitive to colorfulness as"
" it is to relative lightness. Jpeg also uses other :ref:`lossy <"
"lossy_compression>` compression techniques, like using cosine waves to"
" describe image contrasts."

"Because jpeg uses lossy compression, it is not advised to save over the same"
" jpeg multiple times. The lossy compression will cause the file to reduce in"
" quality each time you save it. This is a fundamental problem with lossy"
" compression methods. Instead use a lossless file format, or a working file"
" format while you are working on the image."
