"The Perspective Projection tutorial is one of the Kickstarter 2015 tutorial "
"rewards. It's about something that humanity has known scientifically for a "
"very long time, and decent formal training will teach you about this. But I "

"it in digital painting programs, let alone open source."

"The tutorial is a bit image heavy, and technical, but I hope the skill it "

"raghukamath.com/>`_ for choosing this topic!"
