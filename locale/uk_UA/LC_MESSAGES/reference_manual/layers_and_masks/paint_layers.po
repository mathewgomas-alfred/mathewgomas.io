"Paint layers are the most commonly used type of layers used in digital paint "
"or image manipulation software like Krita.  If you've ever used layers in :"
"program:`Photoshop` or the :program:`Gimp`, you'll be used to how they work. "
"In short, a paint layer,  also called a pixel, bitmap or raster layer, is a "
"bitmap image (an image made up of many points of color)."

"Paint layers let you apply many advanced effects such as smearing, smudging "
"and distorting. This makes them the most flexible type of layer. However,  "
"paint layers don't scale well when enlarged (they pixelate), and any effects "
"that have been applied can't be edited."

"To deal with these two drawbacks, digital artists will typically work at "
"higher Pixel Per Inch (PPI) counts.  It is not unusual to see PPI settings "
"of 400 to 600 PPI for a canvas with a good amount of detail.  To combat the "
"issue of applied effects that cannot be edited it is best to take advantage "
"of the non-destructive layer capabilities of filter, transparency and "
"transform masks."

"As long as you have enough resolution / size on your canvas though, and as "
"long as you aren't going to need to go back and tweak an effect you created "
"previously, then a paint layer is usually the type of layer you will want. "
"If you click on the :guilabel:`New layer` icon in the layers docker you'll "
"get a paint layer. Of course you can always choose the :guilabel:`New layer` "
"dropdown to get another type."
