"The perspective grid tool allows you to draw and manipulate grids on the "
"canvas that can serve as perspective guides for your painting. A grid can be "
"added to your canvas by first clicking the tool in the tool bar and then "
"clicking four points on the canvas which will serve as the four corners of "
"your grid."

"The grid can be manipulated by pulling on any of its four corners. The grid "
"can be extended by clicking and dragging a midpoint of one of its edges. "
"This will allow you to expand the grid at other angles.This process can be "
"repeated on any subsequent grid or grid section. You can join the corners of "
"two grids by dragging one onto the other. Once they are joined they will "
"always move together, they cannot be separated. You can delete any grid by "
"clicking on the red X at its center. This tool can be used to build "
"reference for complex scenes."
