"Snapping is the ability to have Krita automatically align a selection or "
"shape to the grids and guides, document center and document edges. For "
"Vector layers, this goes even a step further, and we can let you snap to "
"bounding boxes, intersections, extrapolated lines and more."

"This will snap the cursor to the current grid, as configured in the grid "

"case for game sprites and grid-based designs."

"This allows you to snap to guides, which can be dragged out from the ruler. "
"Guides do not need to be visible for this, and are saved per document. This "

"Scribus for more intensive work."
