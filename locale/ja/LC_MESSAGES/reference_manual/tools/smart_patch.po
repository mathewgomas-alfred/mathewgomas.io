"The smart patch tool allows you to seamlessly remove elements from the "
"image. It does this by letting you draw the area which has the element you "
"wish to remove, and then it will attempt to use patterns already existing in "
"the image to fill the blank."

"Accuracy indicates how many samples, and thus how often the algorithm is "
"run. A low accuracy will do few samples, but will also run the algorithm "
"fewer times, making it faster. Higher accuracy will do many samples, making "
"the algorithm run more often and give more precise results, but because it "
"has to do more work, it is slower."

"Patch size determines how big the size of the pattern to choose is. This "
"will be best explained with some testing, but if the surrounding image has "
"mostly small elements, like branches, a small patch size will give better "
"results, while a big patch size will be better for images with big elements, "
"so they get reused as a whole."
