"Filter layers show whatever layers are underneath them, but with a filter "
"such as Layer Styles, Blur, Levels, Brightness / Contrast. For example, if "
"you add a **Filter Layer**, and choose the Blur filter, you will see every "
"layer under your filter layer blurred."

"Unlike applying a filter directly on to a section of a Paint Layer, Filter "
"Layers do not actually alter the original image in the Paint Layers below "
"them. Once again, non-destructive editing! You can tweak the filter at any "
"time, and the changes can always be altered or removed."

"Unlike Filter Masks though, Filter Layers apply to the entire canvas for the "
"layers beneath. If you wish to apply a filter layer to only *some* layers, "
"then you can utilize the Group Layer feature and add those layers into a "
"group with the filter layer on top of the stack."

"Only Krita native filters (the ones in the :guilabel:`Filters` menu) can be "
