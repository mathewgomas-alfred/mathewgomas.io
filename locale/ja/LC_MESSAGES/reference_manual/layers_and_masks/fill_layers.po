"This fills the layer with a predefined pattern or texture that has been "
"loaded into Krita through the Resource Management interface.  Patterns can "
"be a simple and interesting way to add texture to your drawing or painting, "
"helping to recreate the look of watercolor paper, linen, canvas, hardboard, "
"stone or an infinite other number of options.  For example if you want to "
"take a digital painting and finish it off with the appearance of it being on "
"canvas you can add a Fill Layer with the Canvas texture from the texture "
"pack below and set the opacity very low so the \"threads\" of the pattern "
"are just barley visible.  The effect is quite convincing."

"A fill-layer is a single-channel layer, meaning it only has transparency. "
"Therefore, you can erase and paint on fill-layers to make them semi-opaque, "
"or for when you want to have a particular color only. Being single channel, "
"fill-layers are also a little bit less memory-consuming than regular 4-"
"channel paint layers."
