"Floating point bit-depths are used by the computer graphics industry to "
"record scene referred values, which can be made via a camera or a computer "
"renderer. Scene referred values means that the file can have values whiter "
"than white, which in turn means that such a file can record lighting "
"conditions, such as sunsets very accurately. These exr files can then be "
"used inside a renderer to create realistic lighting."
