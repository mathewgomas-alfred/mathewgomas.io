"``.ora``, or the Open Raster format, is an interchange format. It was "
"designed to replace :ref:`file_psd` as an interchange format, as the latter "
"isn't meant for that. Like :ref:`file_kra` it is loosely based on the Open "
"Document structure, thus a ZIP file with a bunch of XMLs and PNGs, but where "
"Krita's internal file format can sometimes have fully binary chunks, ``."
"ora`` saves its layers as :ref:`file_png` making it fully open and easy to "
"support."
