"Krita supports the CSV version used by TVPaint, to transfer layered "
"animation between these two softwares and probably with others, like "

"The format consists of a text file with ``.csv`` extension, together with a "
"folder under the same name and a ``.frames`` extension. The CSV file and the "
"folder must be on the same path location. The text file contains the "
"parameters for the scene, like the field resolution and frame rate, and also "
"contains the exposure sheet for the layers. The folder contains :ref:"
"`file_png` picture files. Unlike image sequences, a key frame instance is "
"only a single file and the exposure sheet links it to one or more frames on "
