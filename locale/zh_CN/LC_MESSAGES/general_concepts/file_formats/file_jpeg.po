"Photographs have the problem that they have a lot of little gradients, which "
"means that you cannot index the file like you can with :ref:`file_gif` and "
"expect the result to look good. What jpeg instead does is that it converts "
"the file to a perceptual color space (:ref:`YCrCb <model_ycrcb>`), and then "
"compresses the channels that encode the colors, while keeping the channel "
"that holds information about the relative lightness uncompressed. This works "
"really well because human eye-sight is not as sensitive to colorfulness as "
"it is to relative lightness. Jpeg also uses other :ref:`lossy "
"<lossy_compression>` compression techniques, like using cosine waves to "
"describe image contrasts."
msgstr ""
"照片有大量微妙的颜色渐变，因此并不适合使用 :ref:`file_gif` 的索引颜色方式来进"
"行压缩。JPEG 的解决方案则是把文件转换为可感知模型的色彩空间 (:ref:`YCrCb "
"<model_ycrcb>`)，对颜色通道进行压缩，但不对明度通道进行压缩。这种做法的效果特"
"别好，因为人眼对颜色的敏感程度远不及明度。JPEG 还会使用其他的 :ref:`有损 "
"<lossy_compression>` 压缩技术，例如使用余弦波来描述图像反差等。"

"However, it does mean that jpeg should be used in certain cases. For images "
"with a lot of gradients, like full scale paintings, jpeg performs better "
"than :ref:`file_png` and :ref:`file_gif`."

"But for images with a lot of sharp contrasts, like text and comic book "
"styles, png is a much better choice despite a larger file size. For "
"grayscale images, png and gif will definitely be more efficient."
msgstr ""
"可是对于包含有大量明显反差的图像，如文字和漫画之类的图像风格，PNG 比 JPEG 更"
"加适合，尽管前者文件更大。对于灰阶图像，PNG 和 GIF 的压缩效率都要比 JPEG 更"
"高。"

"Because jpeg uses lossy compression, it is not advised to save over the same "
"jpeg multiple times. The lossy compression will cause the file to reduce in "
"quality each time you save it. This is a fundamental problem with lossy "
"compression methods. Instead use a lossless file format, or a working file "
"format while you are working on the image."

"由于 JPEG 使用了有损压缩方式，不建议用 JPEG 格式反复修改保存文件。有损压缩的"
"特性会在每次保存文件时造成画质的劣化。在编辑图像时应该使用工作文件格式，避免"
"使用有损文件格式。"
