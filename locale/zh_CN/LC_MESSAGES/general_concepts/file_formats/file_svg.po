"While you can open up SVG files with any text-editor to edit them, it is "
"best to use a vector program like Inkscape. Krita 2.9 to 3.3 supports "
"importing SVG via the add shape docker. Since Krita 4.0, SVGs can be "
"properly imported, and you can export singlevector layers via :menuselection:"
"`Layer --> Import/Export --> Save Vector Layer as SVG...`. For 4.0, Krita "
"will also use SVG to save vector data into its :ref:`internal format "
"<file_kra>`."

"SVG is designed for the internet, though sadly, because vector graphics are "
"considered a bit obscure compared to raster graphics, not a lot of websites "
