".psd, unlike actual interchange formats like :ref:`file_pdf`, :ref:"
"`file_tif`, :ref:`file_exr`, :ref:`file_ora` and :ref:`file_svg` doesn't "
"have an official spec online. Which means that it needs to be reverse "
"engineered. Furthermore, as an internal file format, it doesn't have much of "
"a philosophy to its structure, as it's only purpose is to save what "
"photoshop is busy with, or rather, what all the past versions of photoshop "
"have been busy with. This means that the inside of a psd looks somewhat like "
"photoshop's virtual brains, and psd is in general a very disliked file-"
"format."
msgstr ""
".psd 和 :ref:`file_pdf`、:ref:`file_tif`、:ref:`file_exr`、:ref:`file_ora` "
"和 :ref:`file_svg` 等图像交换文件格式不同，在网上是找不到它的官方规范文件的。"
"这意味着其他软件想使用它，必须对其进行逆向工程。还有就是作为一种内建格式，它"
"的文件结构缺乏明显的指导思想，只关注如何把新版本正在关注的功能给添加进来。"
"PSD 文件就像是 Photoshop 清奇思路的化身，大家虽然都在用它，却也都在嫌弃它。"

"Due to .psd being used as an interchange format, this leads to confusion "
"amongst people using these programs, as to why not all programs support "
"opening these. Sometimes, you might even see users saying that a certain "
"program is terrible because it doesn't support opening psds properly. But as "
"psd is an internal file-format without online specs, it is impossible to "
"have any program outside it support it 100%."

"由于 .psd 被用作一种图像交换格式，人们使用图像程序时往往会为某个程序竟然不支"
"持打开 PSD 文件而感到困惑。你有时候会听到用户说某个程序很糟糕，因为它不能良好"
"地支持 PSD 格式。但考虑到 PSD 是一种未公布规范的内建文件格式，其他软件永远也"
"不可能做到对其完美支持。"

"Krita 支持 PSD 格式的栅格图层、混色模式、图层央视、透明度蒙版等功能，但不能，"
