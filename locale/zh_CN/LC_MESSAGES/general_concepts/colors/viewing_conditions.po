"So, usually what we mean by viewing conditions is the lighting and "
"decoration of the room that you are viewing the image in. Our eyes try to "
"make sense of both the colors that you are looking at actively (the colors "
"of the image) and the colors you aren't looking at actively (the colors of "
"the room), which means that both sets of colors affect how the image looks."
msgstr ""
"我们通常所说的观察条件指的是我们观看图像时所在房间的照明和装修情况。我们的眼"
"睛会试图同时理解我们正在注意的颜色 (图像的颜色) 和那些我们并未注意的颜色 (房"

"Lighting is the other component of the viewing condition which can have "
"dramatic effects. Lighting in particular affects the way how all colors "
"look. For example, if you were to paint an image of sunflowers and poppies, "
"print that out, and shine a bright yellow light on it, the sunflowers would "
"become indistinguishable from the white background, and the poppies would "
"look orange. This is called `metamerism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"

"For example, if you are designing a print for a red t-shirt that's not "

"So, by eye-balling your t-shirt's color during the evening, you took its red "

"However, when we start projecting, the lights of the room aren't dimmed, "
