"Choosing the right workspace profile to use depends on how much colors you "

"This is why was created the sRGB profile to fit more different colors in "
"this limited amount of values, in a perceptually regular grading, by "
"applying a custom gamma curve (see picture here: https://en.wikipedia.org/"
"wiki/SRGB) to emulate the standard response curve of old CRT screens. So "
"sRGB profile is optimized to fit all colors that most common screen can "
"reproduce in those 256 values per R/G/B channels. Some other profiles like "
"Adobe RGB are optimized to fit more printable colors in this limited range, "
"primarily extending cyan-green hues. Working with such profile can be useful "
"to improve print results, but is dangerous if not used with a properly "
"profiled and/or calibrated good display. Most common CMYK workspace profile "
"can usually fit all their colors within 8bit/channel depth, but they are all "
"so different and specific that it's usually better to work with a regular "
"RGB workspace first and then convert the output to the appropriate CMYK "
"profile."

"我们前面已经提到过 8 位深度的颜色通道只能容纳 256 种颜色，所以 8 位的非 sRGB "
