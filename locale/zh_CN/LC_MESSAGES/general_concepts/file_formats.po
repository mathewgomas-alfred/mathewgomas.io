#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:25
msgid ""
"Compression is how the file-format tries to describe the image with as "
"little data as possible, so that the resulting file is as small as it can "
"get without losing quality."
msgstr ""
"压缩指的是某种文件格式以尽可能少的数据来描述图像的手段，以便在不损失画质的前"

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:27
msgid ""
"What we generally see is that formats that are small on disk either lose "
"image quality, or require the computer to spend a lot of time thinking about "
"how the image should look."
msgstr ""
"我们通常会发现占用磁盘空间较少的文件格式要么有损画质，要么需要计算机花费大量"
"时间去演算图像的结果。"

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:29
msgid ""
"Vector file-formats like ``svg`` are a typical example of the latter. They "
"are really small because the technology used to create them is based on "
"mathematics, so it only stores maths-variables and can achieve very high "
"quality. The downside is that the computer needs to spend a lot of time "
"thinking about how it should look, and sometimes different programs have "
"different ways of interpreting the values. Furthermore, vector file-formats "
"imply vector graphics, which is a very different way of working than Krita "
"is specialized in."
msgstr ""
"矢量图形格式，如 ``svg`` 是后者的一个典型。这些格式的文件都非常小，因为这些格"
"式全部基于数学运算，保存的都是些数学参数，还可以无视放大倍率实现极高的画质。"
"但它们的缺点是：计算机需要花费大量时间来演算图像应该如何显示，而且不同的程序"
"有时会对同一张图片会有不同的解读结果。最后，Krita 主攻的方向是栅格图像，不是"
"矢量图形。"

":ref:`Lossy file formats <lossy_compression>`, like ``jpg`` or ``webp`` are "
"an example of small on disk, but lowering the quality, and are best used for "

"fast and loose with describing your image to reduce filesize."

":ref:`有损压缩图像格式 <lossy_compression>` ，如 ``jpg`` 和 ``webp`` 都是占用"
"磁盘空间较少但会牺牲画质的例子。它们适用于颜色丰富而反差不明显的图像。有损意"

"Then, there's proper working file formats like Krita's ``.kra``, Gimp's "
"``xcf``, Photoshop's ``psd``, but also interchange formats like ora and exr. "
"These are the heaviest on the hard-drive and often require special programs "
"to open them up, but on the other hand these are meant to keep your working "
"environment intact, and keep all the layers and guides in them."

"然后就是各种软件专属的工作文件格式，如 Krita 的 ``.kra``，Gimp 的 ``xcf``，"
"Photoshop 的 ``psd`` 等。此外还有用来在不同软件之间传递图像的工作文件格式，"

"Metadata is the ability of a file format to contain information outside of "
"the actual image contents. This can be human readable data, like the date of "
"creation, the name of the author, a description of the image, but also "
"computer readable data, like an icc-profile which tells the computer about "
"the qualities of how the colors inside the file should be read."

"元数据是某种文件格式包含的除图像内容之外的信息。它可以是人类能够理解的数据，"
