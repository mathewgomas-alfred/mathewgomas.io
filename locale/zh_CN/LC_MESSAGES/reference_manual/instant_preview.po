"Instant Preview(Previously known under the code name Level Of Detail/LOD "
"strokes) is Krita's special speed-up mechanism that was funded by the 2015 "
"Kickstarter. Krita slows down with really large images due the large amount "
"of data it's crunching in painting these images. Instant Preview works by "
"taking a smaller version of the canvas, and drawing the feedback on there "
"while Krita calculates the real stroke in the background. This means that if "
"you have a 4k screen and are working on a 4k image at 100% zoom, you won't "
"feel any speed up."

"--> configure Krita --> display --> display scaling filter`, then you wont't "

"Similarly, the auto-spacing, fuzzy sensor in size, use of density in brush-"
