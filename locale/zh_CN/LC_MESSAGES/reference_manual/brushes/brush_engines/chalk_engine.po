"Apparently, the Bristle brush engine is derived from this brush engine. Now, "
"all of :program:`Krita's` brushes have a great variety of uses, so you must "
"have tried out the Chalk brush and wondered what it is for. Is it nothing "
"but a pixel brush with opacity and saturation fade options? As per the "
"developers this brush uses a different algorithm than the Pixel Brush, and "
"they left it in here as a simple demonstration of the capabilities of :"
"program:`Krita's` brush engines."

"虽然这个引擎已被移除，但我们保留了此页面来展示 Krita 笔刷引擎的潜力。你或许不"
"会想到，Krita 的鬃毛笔刷引擎竟然是从这个引擎的基础上发展出来的。它和像素引擎"
"使用了不同的算法，但看上去只是一个带有不透明度和饱和度淡化功能的像素笔刷。"

"正如你所见的那样，一个普通的圆形笔刷，带有一点粉笔纹理，然后可以对不透明度和"
"饱和度选项进行淡入淡出。仅此而已。"
