"The Tangent Normal Brush Engine is an engine that is specifically designed "
"for drawing normal maps, of the tangent variety. These are in turn used in "
"3d programs and game engines to do all sorts of lightning trickery. Common "
"uses of normal maps include faking detail where there is none, and to drive "
"transformations(Flow Maps)."

"A Normal map is an image that holds information for vectors. In particular, "
"they hold information for Normal Vectors, which is the information for how "
"the light bends on a surface. Because Normal Vectors are made up of 3 "
"coordinates, just like colors, we can store and see this information as "
"colors."
