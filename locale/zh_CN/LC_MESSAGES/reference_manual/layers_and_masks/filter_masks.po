"Filter masks show an area of their layer with a filter (such as blur, "
"levels, brightness / contrast etc.). For example, if you select an area of a "
"paint layer and add a Filter Layer, you will be asked to choose a filter. If "
"you choose the blur filter, you will see the area you selected blurred."

"With filter masks, we can for example make this ghost-lady more ethereal by "

"Unlike applying a filter to a section of a paint layer directly, filter "
"masks do not permanently alter the original image. This means you can tweak "
"the filter (or the area it applies to) at any time. Changes can always be "
"altered or removed."

"You can edit the settings for a filter mask at any time by double clicking "
"on it in the Layers docker. You can also change the selection that the "
"filter mask affects by selecting the filter mask in the Layers docker and "
"then using the paint tools in the main window. Painting white includes the "
"area, painting black excludes it, and all other colors are turned into a "
"shade of gray which applies proportionally."
