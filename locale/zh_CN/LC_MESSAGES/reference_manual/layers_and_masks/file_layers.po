"File Layers are references to files outside of the document: If the "
"referenced document updates, the file layer will update. Do not remove the "
"original file on your computer once you add it to Krita. Deleting your "
"original image will break the file layer. If Krita cannot find the original "
"file, it'll ask you where to find it. File layers cannot display animations."

"If the imported layer and the image have a different resolution, it'll scale "
"the filelayer by scaling its resolution. In other words, import a 600dpi A4 "
"image onto a 300dpi A4 image, and the filelayer will be scaled to fit "
"precisely on the 300dpi image. Useful for comics, where the ink-layer is "
"preferred to be at a higher resolution than the colors."

"the layer with a file layer pointing at that file."
