"Workspaces are basically saved configurations of dockers.  Each workspace "
"saves how the dockers are grouped and where they are placed on the screen.  "
"They allow you to easily move between workflows without having to manual "
"reconfigure your setup each time.  They can be as simple or as complex as "
"you want."

"This treats the workspace in the first window as the 'primary' workspace, "
"and when you switch focus, it will switch the secondary windows to that "
"primary workspace. This is useful when the secondary workspace is a very "
"sparse workspace with few dockers, and the primary is one with a lot of "
"different dockers."
