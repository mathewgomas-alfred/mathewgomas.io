"Filters are little scripts or operations you can run on your drawing. You "
"can visualize them as real-world camera filters that can make a photo darker "
"or blurrier. Or perhaps like a coffee filter, where only water and coffee "
"gets through, and the ground coffee stays behind."

"Filters are unique to digital painting in terms of complexity, and their "
"part of the painting pipeline. Some artists only use filters to adjust their "
"colors a little. Others, using Filter Layers and Filter Masks use them to "
"dynamically update a part of an image to be filtered. This way, they can "
"keep the original underneath without changing the original image. This is a "
"part of a technique called 'non-destructive' editing."
