".psd, unlike actual interchange formats like :ref:`file_pdf`, :ref:"
"`file_tif`, :ref:`file_exr`, :ref:`file_ora` and :ref:`file_svg` doesn't "
"have an official spec online. Which means that it needs to be reverse "
"engineered. Furthermore, as an internal file format, it doesn't have much of "
"a philosophy to its structure, as it's only purpose is to save what "
"photoshop is busy with, or rather, what all the past versions of photoshop "
"have been busy with. This means that the inside of a psd looks somewhat like "
"photoshop's virtual brains, and psd is in general a very disliked file-"
"format."

"Due to .psd being used as an interchange format, this leads to confusion "
"amongst people using these programs, as to why not all programs support "
"opening these. Sometimes, you might even see users saying that a certain "
"program is terrible because it doesn't support opening psds properly. But as "
"psd is an internal file-format without online specs, it is impossible to "
"have any program outside it support it 100%."
