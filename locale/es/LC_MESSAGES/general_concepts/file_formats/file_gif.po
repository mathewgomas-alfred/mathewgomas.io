".gif is a fileformat mostly known for the fact that it can save animations. "
"It's a fairly old format, and it does it's compression by :ref:`indexing "
"<bit_depth>` the colors to a maximum of 256 colors per frame. Because we can "
"technically design an image for 256 colors and are always able save over an "
"edited gif without any kind of extra degradation, this is a :ref:`lossless "
"<lossless_compression>` compression technique."

"losing any visible quality. But for color images that don't animate it might "
"be better to use :ref:`file_jpg` or :ref:`file_png`."
