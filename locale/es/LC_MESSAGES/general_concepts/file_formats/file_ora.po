".ora, or the Open Raster format, is an interchange format. It was designed "
"to replace :ref:`file_psd` as an interchange format, as the latter isn't "
"meant for that. Like :ref:`file_kra` it is loosely based on the Open "
"Document structure, thus a zip file with a bunch of xmls and pngs, but where "
"Krita's internal fileformat can sometimes have fully binary chunks, .ora "
"saves it's layers as :ref:`file_png` making it fully open and easy to "
"support."
