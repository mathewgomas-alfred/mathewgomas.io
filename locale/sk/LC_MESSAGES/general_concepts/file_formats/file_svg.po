"While you can open up svg files with any text-editor to edit them, it is best"
" to use a vector program like Inkscape. Krita 2.9 to 3.3 supports importing"
" svg via the add shape docker. Since Krita 4.0, SVGs can be properly"
" imported, and you can export singlevector layers via :menuselection:`Layer"
" --> Import/Export --> Save Vector Layer as SVG...`. For 4.0, Krita will also"
" use SVG to save vector data into its :ref:`internal format <file_kra>`."
