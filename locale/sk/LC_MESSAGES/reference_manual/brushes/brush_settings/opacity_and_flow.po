"In Krita 4.1 and below, the flow and opacity when combined with brush "
"sensors would add up to one another, being only limited by the maximum "
"opacity. This was unexpected compared to all other painting applications, so "
"in 4.2 this finally got corrected to the flow and opacity multiplying, "
"resulting in much more subtle strokes. This change can be switched back in "
"the :ref:`tool_options_settings`, but we will be deprecating the old way in "
"future versions."
