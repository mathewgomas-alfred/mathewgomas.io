".jpg, .jpeg or .jpeg2000 are a family of file-formats designed to encode "

"Photographs have the problem that they have a lot of little gradients, which "
"means that you cannot index the file like you can with :ref:`file_gif` and "
"expect the result to look good. What jpeg instead does is that it converts "
"the file to a perceptual color space (:ref:`YCrCb <model_ycrcb>`), and then "
"compresses the channels that encode the colors, while keeping the channel "
"that holds information about the relative lightness uncompressed. This works "
"really well because human eye-sight is not as sensitive to colorfulness as "
"it is to relative lightness. Jpeg also uses other :ref:`lossy "
"<lossy_compression>` compression techniques, like using cosine waves to "
"describe image contrasts."

"However, it does mean that jpeg should be used in certain cases. For images "
"with a lot of gradients, like full scale paintings, jpeg performs better "
"than :ref:`file_png` and :ref:`file_gif`."

"But for images with a lot of sharp contrasts, like text and comic book "
"styles, png is a much better choice despite a larger file size. For "
"grayscale images, png and gif will definitely be more efficient."

"Because jpeg uses lossy compression, it is not advised to save over the same "
"jpeg multiple times. The lossy compression will cause the file to reduce in "
"quality each time you save it. This is a fundamental problem with lossy "
"compression methods. Instead use a lossless file format, or a working file "
"format while you are working on the image."
