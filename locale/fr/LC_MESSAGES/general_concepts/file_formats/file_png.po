"`file_gif` and with that and :ref:`file_jpg` it makes up the three main "
"formats that are widely supported on the internet."

"png is a :ref:`lossless <lossless_compression>` file format, which means "
"that it is able to maintain all the colors of your image perfectly. It does "
"so at the cost of the file size being big, and therefore it is recommended "
"to try :ref:`file_jpg` for images with a lot of gradients and different "
"colors. Grayscale images will do better in png as well as images with a lot "
"of text and sharp contrasts, like comics."

"Like :ref:`file_gif`, png can support indexed color. Unlike :ref:`file_gif`, "
"png doesn't support animation. There have been two attempts at giving "
"animation support to png, apng and mng, the former is unofficial and the "
"latter too complicated, so neither have really taken off yet."
