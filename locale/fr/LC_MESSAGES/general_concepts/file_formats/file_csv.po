".csv is the abbreviation for Comma Separated Values. It is an open, plain "
"text spreadsheet format. Since the .csv format is a plain text itself, it is "
"possible to use a spreadsheet program or even a text editor to edit the .csv "
"file."

"Krita supports the .csv version used by TVPaint, to transfer layered "
"animation between these two softwares and probably with others, like "
"Blender. This is not an image sequence format, so use the document loading "
"and saving functions in Krita instead of the :guilabel:`Import animation "
"frames` and :guilabel:`Render Animation` menu items."

"The format consists of a text file with .csv extension, together with a "
"folder under the same name and a .frames extension. The .csv file and the "
"folder must be on the same path location. The text file contains the "
"parameters for the scene, like the field resolution and frame rate, and also "
"contains the exposure sheet for the layers. The folder contains :ref:"
"`file_png` picture files. Unlike image sequences, a key frame instance is "
"only a single file and the exposure sheet links it to one or more frames on "
"the timeline."
