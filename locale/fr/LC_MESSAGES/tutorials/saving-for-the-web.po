"Krita's default saving format is the :ref:`file_kra` format. This format "
"saves everything Krita can manipulate about an image: Layers, Filters, "
"Assistants, Masks, Color spaces, etc. However, that's a lot of data, so ``*."
"kra`` files are pretty big. This doesn't make them very good for uploading "
"to the internet. Imagine how many people's data-plans hit the limit if they "
"only could look at ``*.kra`` files! So instead, we optimise our images for "
"the web."

"Flatten all layers. This turns all your layers into a single one. Just go "
"to :menuselection:`Layer --> Flatten Image` or press :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:"

"don't be scared if Krita freezes for a few seconds. It'll become responsive "

"Resize! Go to :menuselection:`Image --> Scale Image To New Size` or use :kbd:"
"`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Alt` + :kbd:`I`. This calls up the resize menu. A good rule "
"of thumb for resizing is that you try to get both sizes to be less than 1200 "
"pixels. (This being the size of HD formats). You can easily get there by "
"setting the **Resolution** under **Print Size** to **72** dots per inch. "
"Then press **OK** to have everything resized."
