msgid "Issues with rendering animation can be of various shapes and colors. First thing to find out is whether the issue happens on Krita's or ffmpeg's side (Krita saves all the frames, then ffmpeg is used to render a video using this sequence of images). To learn that, instruct the user to render as \"Image Sequence\". If the image sequence is correct, ffmpeg (or more often: render options) are at fault. If the image sequence is incorrect, either the options are wrong (if for example not every frame got rendered), or it's a bug in Krita."
