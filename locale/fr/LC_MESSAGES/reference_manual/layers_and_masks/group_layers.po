"While working in complex artwork you'll often find the need to group the "
"layers or some portions and elements of the artwork in one unit. Group "
"layers come in handy for this, they allow you to make a segregate the "
"layers, so you can hide these quickly, or so you can apply a mask to all the "
"layers inside this group as if they are one, you can also recursively "
"transform the content of the group... Just drag the mask so it moves to the "
"layer. They are quickly made with :kbd:`Ctrl + G`."

"A thing to note is that the layers inside a group layer are considered "
"separately when the layer gets composited, the layers inside a group are "
"separately composited and then this image is taken in to account when "
"compositing the whole image, while on the contrary, the groups in Photoshop "
"have something called pass-through mode which makes the layer behave as if "
"they are not in a group and get composited along with other layers of the "
"stack. The recent versions of Krita have pass-through mode you can enable it "
"to get similar behavior"
