"Normally, a changing to a different brush preset will change all brush "
"settings. Locked presets are a way for you to prevent Krita from changing "
"all settings. So, if you want to have the texture be that same over all "
"brushes, you lock the texture parameter. That way, all brush-preset you "
"select will now share the same texture!"
