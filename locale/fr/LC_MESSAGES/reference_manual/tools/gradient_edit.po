"This tool allows you to edit the gradient on canvas, but it only works for "
"vector layers. If you have a vector shape selected, and draw a line over the "
"canvas, you will be able to see the nodes, and the stops in the gradient. "
"Move around the nodes to move the gradient itself. Select the stops to "
"change their colour in the tool options docker, or to move their position in "
"the on canvas gradient. You can select preset gradient in the tool docker to "
"change the active shape's gradient to use those stops."
