"When we compress a file, we do this because we want to temporarily make it "
"smaller (like for sending over email), or we want to permanently make it "
"smaller (like for showing images on the internet)."
msgstr "Quando comprimimos um ficheiro, fazemos isso porque desejamos torná-lo temporariamente mais pequeno (por exemplo, para enviá-lo por e-mail) ou de forma permanente (como para mostrar imagens pela Internet)."

"*Lossless* compression techniques are for when we want to *temporarily* "
"reduce information. As the name implies, they compress without losing "
"information. In text, the use of abbreviations is a good example of a "
"lossless compression technique. Everyone knows 'etc.' expands to 'etcetera', "
"meaning that you can half the 8 character long 'etcetera' to the four "
"character long 'etc.'."

"Within image formats, examples of such compression is by for example "
"'indexed' color, where we make a list of available colors in an image, and "
"then assign a single number to them. Then, when describing the pixels, we "
"only write down said number, so that we don't need to write the color "
"definition over and over."

"*Lossy* compression techniques are for when we want to *permanently* reduce "
"the file size of an image. This is necessary for final products where having "
"a small filesize is preferable such as a website. That the image will not be "
"edited anymore after this allows for the use of the context of a pixel to be "
"taken into account when compressing, meaning that we can rely on "
"psychological and statistical tricks."

"One of the primary things JPEG for example does is chroma sub-sampling, that "
"is, to split up the image into a greyscale and two color versions (one "
"containing all red-green contrast and the other containing all blue-yellow "
"contrast), and then it makes the latter two versions smaller. This works "
"because humans are much more sensitive to differences in lightness than we "
"are to differences in hue and saturation."

"Another thing it does is to use cosine waves to describe contrasts in an "
"image. What this means is that JPEG and other lossy formats using this are "
"*very good at describing gradients, but not very good at describing sharp "
"contrasts*."
msgstr "Outra coisa que faz é usar ondas de co-senos para descrever os contrastes numa imagem. O que isto significa é que o JPEG e outros formatos com perdas que usam isto são *muito bons a descrever gradientes, mas não são muito bons a descrever contrastes vincados*."

"Conversely, lossless image compression techniques are *really good at "
"describing images with few colors thus sharp contrasts, but are not good to "
"compress images with a lot of gradients*."
msgstr "Por outro lado, as técnicas de compressão sem perdas são *realmente boas a descrever imagens com poucas cores, mas com contrastes bem definidos, mas não são boas a comprimir imagens com bastantes gradientes*."

"Another big difference between lossy and lossless images is that lossy "
"fileformats will degrade if you re-encode them, that is, if you load a jpeg "
"into Krita edit a little, resave, edit a little, resave, each subsequent "
"save will lose some data. This is a fundamental part of lossy image "
"compression, and the primary reason we use working files."

"If you're interested in different compression techniques, `Wikipedia's "
"page(s) on image compression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Image_compression>`_ are very good, if not a little technical."
msgstr "Se estiver interessado nas diferentes técnicas de compressão, a `página do Wikipédia sobre a compressão de imagens <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_compression>`_ é bastante boa, mas um pouco técnica demais."
