"png is a :ref:`lossless <lossless_compression>` fileformat, which means that "
"it is able to maintain all the colors of your image perfectly. It does so at "
"the cost of the file size being big, and therefore it is recommended to try :"
"ref:`file_jpg` for images with a lot of gradients and different colors. "
"Grayscale images will do better in png as well as images with a lot of text "
"and sharp contrasts, like comics."

"Like :ref:`file_gif`, png can support indexed color. Unlike :ref:`file_gif`, "
"png doesn't support animation. There have been two attempts at giving "
"animation support to png, apng and mng, the former is unofficial and the "
"latter too complicated, so neither have really taken off yet."
